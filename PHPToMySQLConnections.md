#### What do you mean by 'front-end' and 'back-end'?

Any web-application comprises of two main "divisions"; the front-end and the back-end.

* The front-end is what is seen and used by a user.
* The back-end is all the work that is being done in the background that is hidden from the user.
* **For example**; On the Google website, all the links and pictures and whatever you can see is the front-end. The back-end is whatever that goes on in the background, such as Google getting all the information from a database and displaying them onto the webpage.
